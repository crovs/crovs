# 💫 Hey There!:
🌟 About Me<br>Hey there! I'm Ahmet, 👋<br><br>🎓 Student by Day,<br>Aspiring iOS Developer by Night 🌙<br><br>I'm currently a student with a big dream—creating sleek, user-friendly iOS apps that people love. My journey in the world of coding started with curiosity, and now it's turning into a passion for developing Swift and designing with SwiftUI.<br><be>

🚀 My Mission<br>I'm on a mission to turn ideas into reality, one line of code at a time. Right now, I'm focused on:<br><br>Mastering Swift: Diving deep into the language and exploring its endless possibilities.<br>Building Projects: Creating simple, yet powerful apps to sharpen my skills.<br>Connecting with the Community: Learning from and contributing to the open-source world.<br>

🎯 What's Next?<br>As I continue my studies, I'm aiming to:<br><br>Launch My First App: Get my first app live on the App Store. Stay tuned!<br>Contribute to Open Source: Give back to the community that’s helping me grow.<br>Keep Learning: Because in tech, the journey never truly ends!<be>

🌱 Always Growing<br>I'm just at the beginning of my developer journey, but I'm committed to continuous learning and improvement. Whether it's tackling new challenges or collaborating on exciting projects, I'm here to grow, share, and build something awesome.<br><be>


## Projects along the Journey:



- [HORNews ARp](link): The "H4X0R News" app is a project I built to learn and practice key iS development concepts using SwiftUI. Through this app, I explored list management, networking, the Observer design pattern, and integrating UIKit components with SwiftUI. It served as a hands-on way to deepen my understanding of these essential tools and techniques, helping me grow as an i0S developer.
  
- [BusinessCard App](link): I created the "BusinessCard" app to learn how to design and implement complex layouts using SwiftUI. This project allowed me to experiment with SwiftUI's powerful layout tools and design capabilities, helping me to better understand how to build visually appealing and functional interfaces in iOS apps.
  
- [Flash Chat](link): I built the "FlashChat" app to deepen my understanding of various iS development concepts, including navigation controller stacks, UITableView customization, and integration of Firebase for user authentication and real-time data management. This project also allowed me to explore third-party libraries, animations, and the intricacies of managing the keyboard and lifecycle methods in iOS apps.
  
- [ByteCoin](link): I developed the "ByteCoin" app to learn how to integrate APIs, handle JSON data, and update the UI dynamically in an iOS app. This project helped me master networking with URLSession, use UlPickerView for user interaction, and implement the delegate pattern to keep the app's interface responsive and up-to-date with real-time cryptocurrency prices.
  
?logo=clima - [Clima](link): I developed the "Clima" app primarily to master API integration and networking in iOS. This project involved using URLSession to fetch weather data from the Openweather API, parsing JSON responses, and dynamically updating the UI based on real-time data and user location.
  
- [Tipsy](link): I built the "Tipsy" app to learn advanced Swift programming and to develop a practical tool for splitting bills and calculating tips. The app handles user inputs, calculates the total per person, and passes the results between view controllers, providing a seamless experience for sharing payments among friends.
